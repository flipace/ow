# core

**ow** [pronounced: oouhh] is a node.js framework which enforces certain patterns and restrictions in order to provide you with a stable, testable and modular application architecture.

It's aim is to provide you with a small set of core functions and a diverse set of **ow modules** which can be added and replaced depending on the needs of your application.

The way you write modules for **ow** is also straightforward and kept as simple as possible.

If you adhere to **ow**s patterns, you'll end up with applications that are modular, stable and easy to test as well as custom modules which can easily be extracted and reused in different applications.
