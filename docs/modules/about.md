# Modules

**ow** is built upon the idea of splitting your application into and reusable modules.

While using modules created by others is always kind of easy, with **ow** we took this a step further
by ensuring that you can create your own modules with as little code as possible.

That's the reason why **ow** is able to keep you inside the *"module"* mindest during development
without getting in your way through obscure coding conventions or requirements.
